# HASHMAPS

## INTRODUCTION

What is hashmaps?
- A HashMap (or Hash Table) is a key-value data structure that provides O(1) average time complexity for insertions, deletions, and searching.
- HashMaps provide fast lookups compared to arrays (O(N)) and binary search trees (O(log N)).
- ideal for fast data retrieval, frequency counting, caching, and optimizing algorithms. 


## How it Works:

Hash Function: Converts a key into a numeric index.
Indexing: Maps the hash value to an array index.
Collision Handling: Resolves cases where multiple keys get the same index.

## Common Implementations:

C++ â†’ unordered_map<int, string> myMap;

## Implementation
- can be done using HASHTABLES!!
