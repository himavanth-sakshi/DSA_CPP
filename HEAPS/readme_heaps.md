**INTRODUCTION**
1. Heaps are a complete Binary trees that come with HEAP order property
2. Mostly used for 
- priority Queues 
- Dijkstra's algorithm 
- Heapsort

Complete Binary trees --> two properties 
- every level is completely filled expect last level
- Nodes always added from the left lean towards the left


HEAP order property --> two types 
1. Max heap : Every parent is bigger than child 
2. Min Leap : Every child is bigger than parent
